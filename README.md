## Instructions to how to run code ##

1. Download the zip file from eDimension

2. Using Python 3, run the code for each part and for each language (EN/FR/CN/SG). 
    1. For ```p<number of part>```, specify the number of the part of the project to run its respective python code. For example, p2 for part 2's code.

    2. For ```<directory path with train, dev.in and dev.out files>/<language>```, specify the directory path of the files as per stored in your computer for each langauge (EN/FR/CN/SG). For example, ```"/Users/admin/Desktop/EN"``` to run code to test on EN files.s

The full command line code to run would be:

```python3 p<number of part>.py -d "<directory path with train, dev.in and dev.out files>/<language>"```

A full example command line code to run the scripts for scenario: run part 2's code for EN

```python3 p2.py -d "/Users/admin/Desktop/EN"```

3. The resulting output files (e.g. dev.p2.out) generated can be found in the directory for each language.
